Elegant is best maintained when you treat it as a separate resource in your project. Do not edit template files, JavaScript code and style sheets. This practice will make upgrading Elegant fuss free process. Instead use following recommended ways. Customize Style To customize Elegant's visual style, use custom.css . You can override Elegant's visual style like font, color, spacing etc using this sheet. This empty style sheet is present at following path in your Elegant folder, static/css/custom.css Find the code of the element you want to customize in elegant.css . Copy the element's selector and styles, and paste it in custom.css . Edit this CSS code and customize it to your liking. Your customizations will override whatever rules are defined in elegant.css . Let's take a look how you can change the style of hyperlinks in an article. Following is the relevant code, article p :not ( #list-of-translations ) :not ( #post-share-links ) a , article ol a , article div .article-content ul :not ( .articles-timeline ) :not ( .related-posts-list ) a { border-bottom : thin dashed #A9A9A9 ; color : #000 ; } Copy and paste it in custom.css . Change color to red for example, article p :not ( #list-of-translations ) :not ( #post-share-links ) a , article ol a , article div .article-content ul :not ( .articles-timeline ) :not ( .related-posts-list ) a { border-bottom : thin dashed #A9A9A9 ; color : red ; } Test your website using Pelican. All links should be colored red. Read this post to make sure your site's page speed does not decrease due to additional HTTP request. Change Syntax Highlight Theme Elegant uses Solarized theme for syntax highlighting. To replace it, copy contents of your preferred theme's CSS style sheet into custom.css . Alternatively, you can replace contents of pygments.css with your theme's style sheet. If you feel like experimenting with different themes then this repository has Pygments CSS of Vim themes. This one has Pygments CSS of built-in styles. Do not forget to change .codehilite CSS class identifier to .highlight . Code blocks in Pelican generated HTML use .highlight class. Change Labels It is quite possible you will feel the need to tweak labels of different sections or widgets. For example, change label of social widget from \"Contact\" to \"Stay in Touch\". Don't worry! We got you covered! Elegant has all the customizable variables in one place. _defaults.html file . templates/_includes/_defaults.html Let's see how can we change social widget label. 1 2 3 4 5 6 {# Label for the list of social profiles #} {% if not SOCIAL_PROFILE_LABEL %} {% set SOCIAL_PROFILE_LABEL = 'Contact' %} {% else %} {% set SOCIAL_PROFILE_LABEL = SOCIAL_PROFILE_LABEL %} {% endif %} Line 1, text enclosed in {# #} is a comment, which says this section is about \"Label for the list of social profiles\". The text in all capital case SOCIAL_PROFILE_LABEL is the actual variable. Line 3 says SOCIAL_PROFILE_LABEL is set to Contact . To change this value, assign it a different value in your Pelican configuration, pelicanconf.py . SOCIAL_PROFILE_LABEL = 'Stay in Touch' That's it. The title of social widget will change. There are several others labels that you can customize easily without touching Elegant's source code.","tags":"Elegant - Pelican Theme","loc":"/how-to-customize-elegant","title":"How to Customize Elegant"}]}
